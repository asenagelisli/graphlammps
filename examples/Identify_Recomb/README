* This is an example script to identify the reaction mechanisms that lead to O2 formation during sequential collisions.
* It requires as inputs the outputs from reaxff/bonds and LAMMPS dump commands.
* The algo sorts the mechanisms into
      1. Gas-phase  (can be recombination or exchange)
      2. Eley-Rideal
      3. Langmuir-Hinselwood
      4. Physisorption Induced
      5. Exhange reactions (happening near the surface)
      6. Short (Extremely short lived O-O complexes)
